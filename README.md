# MechaCar_Analysis
Module 16 - Using R

# Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Which variabe provided a non- random amount of variance to the MPG values?
- Vehicle Weight
- spoiler_angle
- AWD

Is our linear model slope zero or non-zero?
- Our linear models slope is non-zero because the P-value is less than 0.05.

# Summary Statistics on Suspention coils.
The Mechcar suspention coils mist not exceed 100 lbs per square inch.
- Lot 1 & 2 both are designed with these specifications in mind and both have pretty much the same mean and median.
- Lot 3 has a large difference in the variance of these specifications.

# T-test on Suspesion Coils
- The PSI Values for lot 1 & 3 are statistically not much different from the population mean (Mu).
- on lot 2 the suspention coils are statistically more different from the population mean

# Study Design: Mechcar vs. Competition
What metric or metrics are you going to test?

- Other metrics I would be interested in testing would be horsepower, MPG and engine size. these are three inmportant areas of a car that any well informed consumer should know about extensively.

What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?

-Our null hypothesis in this scenario would be that our car is the same as the competition.

What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why? What data is needed to run the statistical test?

- The tests we would use are our T-test on all types of competitor vehicles.
